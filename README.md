# Medieval Mayhem

Medieval Mayhem is a fun spin on the dinosaur game that
pops up in Chrome when there is no WiFi.

Instead of a dinosaur, we have a dragon. Instead of cacti,
we have castles, and instead of birds, we have arrows. This game
is controlled using the up and down arrow keys, or it can be
controlled using the 'w' and 's' keys. The goal of the game is
to get as high of a score as possible.

## Installation Instructions
In order to play the game, install the pygame library. After that,
clone this repository, run the play_game.py file and enjoy!

Good luck!
