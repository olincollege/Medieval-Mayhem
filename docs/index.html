<h1>Medieval Mayhem!!</h1>
<h2>A familiar game with a fun twist</h2>
<h4>Inspired by Google’s offline dinosaur game, medieval mayhem presents a classic favorite with a medieval twist. Move
    the dragon up and down to dodge castles and arrows, all while watching your score go higher and higher!</h4>

<h2>Game Features</h2>

<h3>Collision Detection</h3>
<p>We’ve implemented collision detection in our game, so the player won’t be able to take on our challenge easily. The
    images have bounding boxes that have been mostly fitted to the objects, which provides the player with an easy way
    of
    avoiding obstacles.</p>
<h3>Randomized Obstacle Speeds</h3>
<p>Randomized obstacle speeds have been added so the player has more of a challenge. Arrows come flying out of nowhere
    and will really test the reaction speed of the player. Maneuverability is key, and we hope it provides a more
    challenging experience!</p>
<h3>Switching Image Animation</h3>
<p>As an appealing final visual touch, the dragon switches between two image states whenever the player presses a
    movement key. The dragon looks like it is flying, soaring from the user’s imagination.</p>
<h3>Updating Score</h3>
<p>Our score feature constantly updates as the player moves through the state of the game. It's a great way to keep
    track of how your game is going.</p>
<h3>Start and Exit Buttons</h3>
<p>We included ease-of-access buttons so it’s really simple to navigate through our game. Our start button on the
    start screen, exit button on the end screen are intuitive, allowing you to start or exit the game.</p>
